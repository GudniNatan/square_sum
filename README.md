# square_sum
Square-Sum Problem computed via recursion

This is a python 2 / 3 program to compute solutions for the [Square-Sum Problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1m7goLCJDY).

## Recursive VS Non-recursive

The recursive version will be faster, but will encounter an error when dealing with large numbers.
The non-recursive version will be slower, but MAYBE more reliable. The non-recursive version also takes up a large amount of memory for bigger numbers.

## Quick-Start for beginners
1. Download and install Python 3 to your computer from https://www.python.org/ (Python 2 is ok too).
2. Download 'square_sum_recursion.py' and open it with the IDLE editor via right click menu. 
3. Run it by pressing F5
4. Pick any number
