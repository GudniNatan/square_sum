Square-Sum Problem computed via recursion

This is a python 2 / 3 program to compute solutions for the [Square-Sum Problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1m7goLCJDY).

## Recursive VS Non-recursive

The recursive version will be faster, but will encounter an error when dealing with large numbers.
The non-recursive version will be slower, but more reliable. The non-recursive version also takes up a HUGE amount of memory for large numbers.
